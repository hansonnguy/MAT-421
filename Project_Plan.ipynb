        "# 1. Introduction\n",
        "Understanding electromagnetic waves is fundamental to engineering communication systems and electronic devices. Waveguides are structures designed to direct electromagnetic waves along a specific path, making them essential in microwave and optical applications such as integrated photonics and fiber optics. The propagation of electric fields within waveguides is a key factor in optimizing communication efficiency. Maxwell’s equations govern these wave dynamics, but their complexity requires numerical approaches to obtain practical solutions. The Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method is a powerful computational technique for solving Maxwell’s equations with waveguide-specific boundary conditions. This project aims to simulate electric field propagation in a dielectric slab waveguide using FDTD, allowing us to analyze key parameters such as mode distribution, dispersion, and attenuation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In FDTD methods, both time and space are discretized, generating a numerical grid. Once the grid is discretized, we can use numerical methods to solve higher dimensional differential equations, like those of Maxwell’s equations. FDTD enables the simulation of transient wave behavior, allowing researchers to study modal distributions, dispersion, and attenuation effects in waveguides. In this project, FDTD methods will be implemented to simulate electric field propagation in waveguides.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Related work\n",
        "\n",
        "Some key introductions to FDTD include work from Taflove and Hagness (2005), which provides an introduction to implementing FDTD techniques, demonstrating their accuracy in modeling wave behavior. Using discrete numericals grids to solve Maxwell’s equations was first introduced by Yee (1966), which remains a foundation for modern FDTD implementations. Recent research has explored the application of FDTD in more modern applications such as photonic crystal waveguides and metamaterials. However, these structures tend to be far more complicated and optimization becomes challenging due to complications in handling boundary conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. Proposed methodology/ models\n",
        "\n",
        "We can discretize space and time by generating a spatial and temporal grid. In doing so, we can assign a magnetic field H and electric field E to each gridpoint. We can then use the finite differences methods learned in the class to calculate the curl of the magnetic fields in each point in space to obtain the electric field. This is the basis for the FDTD method to solve Maxwell’s curl equations, which ensures numerical stability by staggering the grid points. We can set up boundary conditions and set them at certain grid points to ensure that the dielectric slab waveguide structure with predefined dimensions and refractive indices is simulated properly. To mitigate reflections at simulation boundaries, Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) are employed, improving accuracy in field confinement. A Gaussian pulse serves as the excitation source to observe propagation characteristics. To ensure computational efficiency, it might be of interest to implement adaptive meshing techniques, like refining the grid in high-field regions while coarsening it elsewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Experiment setups\n",
        "\n",
        "The simulation is conducted using an FDTD solver implemented in MATLAB or Python. A structured grid with sufficiently high resolution will be employed to capture the wave dynamics accurately. The dielectric constants and refractive indices for the core and cladding materials are carefully defined to ensure realistic modeling. We can introduce a broadband Gaussian excitation to test different frequencies. Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) or Mur’s absorbing boundary conditions are applied to prevent artificial reflections. By varying waveguide parameters such as core thickness and refractive index contrast, we analyze the effects on modal propagation. The numerical results obtained are compared against analytical solutions to validate the accuracy of the model. Additionally, convergence studies are performed by refining the grid and adjusting the time step to ensure numerical stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. Expected results\n",
        "\n",
        "The expected outcomes of the simulation include visualizing electric field distributions within the waveguide and identifying modal field patterns based on waveguide parameters. The propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves, including dispersion and attenuation effects, will be analyzed along the waveguide. By comparing numerical results with theoretical models, the accuracy of the FDTD implementation will be validated."
